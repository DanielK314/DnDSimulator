ToDoList:
20. Legendary Action
30. bessere/mehr Monster
40. Make it possible to simulate 2 or more encounters after one another, mybe short rest
41. Maybe one day, the Entities are Initiated with Items, which then are their own class

61. implement better Smart Heal, is already pretty good I think
61.1 Think about how to handle healing potion
62. are unconscious Players attacked too often
68. Update the GUI that the Spell Book displays Casting Time for the Spell
75. Progress Bar improve
87. Improve the Performance Calculation in Statistical Recap
88. Spider Web targets remain restreained
89. make a Benchmark, meaning a variety of fight Situations for the Attacking Player to do their turn
89.1 make an analysis of their choices, an analysis of their Attack targets

93. Add a python script that checks the current entity and archive and updates the json files
94. automate spell cast recap 
96. improve inspiration choice class score
97. Spellcasting draws a lot of time
98. heal takes some time also
106. target_attack_score takes a lot of time
108. Maybe give Scores to Tokens, so that Choices and Score Functions can loop a Characters Tokens instead of a long if else list
109. Check Combat Inspiration, maybe Token?
110. Make Poison Bite Costimizable

115. Idea: Tokens could have danger ratings and that could factor into the decision making
116. The DM should have the fight, instead of giving the fight to the functions on every move
116.1 Redo sim structure, so that the DM simulates the fight, so do_the_fighting should be a DM class function
116.2 If called, the DM gets the fight, and sets it as a object variables, so all Entities of this DM can then Acess the fight at all points through the DM
117. Fixed, but might need rechecking: Big Problems with Cast Level in Spell and Spell Score, Cast level not yet set in Spell Score function
118. Exhaustion implement, then add to Sickening Ray, Exhaustion is quite tricky to implement, as it goes into deep levels of game structure
119. Give the Concentration Tokens the Score, so that later the AI could decide to break concentration for something else
120. improve choose_player_to_protect
121. Choice handling in alternativ Choices, like choices in wildshape
123. smarter try_wild_shape_heal, in general shape HP heal?
123.1 Currently heal is always applied to CHP, never to shape HP, maybe actually fine for now
124. Add the possibility to disable choices
125. Polymorph
125.1 Polymorph against unwilling Creatures
125.2 Polymorph other then TRex
125.3 maybe improve the score system in polymorph a bit more
125.4 Polymorph Wis save for unwilling creatures
126. Make random spell score value dependent on the strategy level of caster
127. Just quick Idea, Characters could also have something of a self evalued Score. They could calculate at the end of thier turn, how good they are holding up, if they need help and how thier recources are depleated and save that in a score. Other AIs could then use this score for thier decision making. Would be more time efficient then letting the AI calculate it for every singe decision. But on the other hand, things change between turns
129. Magic Missile adds a death save fail for each individual missile (seems hard/unfixable for now)
130. Cast Con Spell before going into wild shape would be good, did some imporvement here to AI
131. Wall of Fire fixed, but could be smarter, and protect more player
132. Choices in Wild shape. The current way how player behave in wild shape is deeply suboptimal
133. I think some of the conditions do not apply to saves yet
134. Streamline the creation of Summons, make it via the entity.summon_entity() function


Spells to do
-Ray of Frost, could be interesting with movement
-think about spike growth
-Web, could be interesting
-Hold Person

Artificer:
Infusions:
-Homunculus Servant
-Mind Sharpener (succ. on Con saves)
-Eldritch Cannon
-

Game Test:
1. You should be testing if the position management and attack choosing is sensable
2. The Choose Att Target Function was been redone and need checking
5. Test driven programming, pytest
6. Are unconscious player attacked to often?
